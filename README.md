# Dememtory

Dememtory was my entry in Ludum Dare 41 gamejam. The theme was "two incompatible genres" and I chose the old card game Memory and the illness Dementia.

It is a text adventure game that runs straight in your console. It is written in C++ and (at least the windows version) is made from scratch without any libraries.

The Linux/osX port is using ncurses for text rendering as it seems that working in the terminal on those systems was a nightmare. It also showed that getting the state of keypresses on Linux/osX is close to impossible, so that version is unfortunately very gimped. Who would have thought developing on windows would be so much easier?? ;-)
